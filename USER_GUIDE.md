### AI Playground

Himarket provides an AI Playground for quickly experiencing AI resources, such as chatting with models and combining models with MCP Servers.

**Call Models and MCP:**

1. Login to the developer portal
2. Enter the 【Playground】page

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f324e384-845e-4201-9ca4-2ebd3ab75350)
