## Development Workflow

### 1. Sync and Create a Branch

Before starting work, sync your fork with the upstream repository:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from upstream
git pull upstream main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Write Your Code

Write your code following our [coding standards](#-coding-standards).

### 3. Format Your Code

**Before committing**, always format your code to ensure it meets our style guidelines:

```bash
# Format Java code (required)
mvn spotless:apply

# Format frontend code if you modified it
cd himarket-web/himarket-admin
npm run format
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Your commit messages should be clear and descriptive:

**Common types:**
- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf` - Performance improvements

### Automated Checks

Every PR will automatically trigger the following checks:

1. **PR Check** - Validates your PR title and description format (Required ✅)
2. **Code Format Check** - Runs `mvn spotless:check` to verify code formatting (Required ✅)

**All checks must pass** before your PR can be merged. If a check fails, the bot will comment with instructions on how to fix it.

## Coding Standards

### Java Code

**Code Formatting (Required):**
- Run `mvn spotless:apply` before committing to auto-format your code
- This ensures consistent code style across the project
- **CI will fail** if code is not formatted

**Best Practices:**
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes
- Add Javadoc comments for public APIs
- Avoid magic numbers and empty catch blocks
- Keep methods focused and reasonably sized
- Remove unused imports

### TypeScript/React Code

- **Formatting**: Use Prettier to format your code: `npm run format`
- **Style Guide**: Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- **Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript types/interfaces; avoid `any` when possible
- **Components**: Prefer functional components with React Hooks
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names; follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions

### Database Migrations

- **Tool**: Use Flyway for all database schema changes
- **Location**: Place migration files in `himarket-bootstrap/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- **Naming**: Follow the pattern `V{version}__{description}.sql`
  - Example: `V3__Add_product_feature.sql`
- **Testing**: Always test your migrations on a clean database before submitting
